The Rust Blog App project is a simple blog application built in Rust using Actix-web as the web framework and PostgreSQL for data storage. The application allows users to register, log in, add, and delete posts through a command-line interface, as well as interact with the blog via a REST API.  

Key Features:  
User registration and authentication.  
Creation, deletion, and viewing of posts through the command line.  
REST API for interacting with the blog.  
Technologies:  
Rust  
Actix-web  
PostgreSQL  
REST API  
Development Plan:  
Setting up the environment and basic project structure.  
Implementation of basic functionality: authentication and post operations.  
Integration with HTML and REST API.  
Testing and debugging.  
Documentation and deployment.  
The project is being developed for educational purposes to explore Rust's capabilities and create a simple application using this language.
